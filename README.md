# IASc-Summer-Project

Performed study on a 1-D Grating structure, whose MATLAB simulated (RCWA simulation) transmission data was analysed and in turn
used to make a Machine Learning Regression Model that can predict the refractive index of an analyte material.

Prepared a well cleansed data and used Random Forest regressor model to predict r.f. based on a given spectrum.

Further Performed hyperparameter tuning to study the effects of hyperparameters on accuracy of the model.

Currently working on building a nano-structure design optimization algorithm as part of the dessertation.
